# Snake Game


It is know 5 am in my city and I don't know why I wanted so hard to make this shitty version of snake. I guess other modifications will be easier, such as restarting the game, some fixes.
However, this game took me around 5 hours to make only because of my mistakes that I didn't really understand. I had an idea at the start, I even made a sketch when I was heading home 
by the bus on my phone.

However, my first plan didn't work. As it could be seen in the changedirection function, there are some codeblocks that I have '//'-ed, but they represent my tears and time spent on nothing.
I really want to understand why some things didn't work, because I have tried the same changedirection function without the block class and it didn't work. But after I have made a new blovk class,
suddenly it worked. I was really suprised with that result. I think it was my stubborness that wanted to make the snake, even though it is an easy game to implement and I have wasted 5 hours on this.
But I think it is alright, hope you will try it. 

Here are some screenshots from the game:
