# Game

At the start I wanted to understand some of the Java better, so I went to a website where the classes and functions were explained. I used https://www.w3schools.com/java and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org for learning some stuff. After that I reviewed some of my old games that I made during Intro to CS on Processing and was thinking on which game to implement. At first I was thinking about something not so hard and popular, as the pingpong game, but then I have seen on Discord that someone has already done it. 




The screenshot below shows the starting screen with the 'good fruit' that could be eaten and the score increments.

Next Screenshot shows the white 'bad fruit'. If you will eat it, the game ends and the third screenshot pops out.

This screenshot below shows how the end screen looks like. A rectangle with a number, which represesnts the score on it.
