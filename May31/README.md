# Game
At the start, I wanted to understand some of Java better, so I went to a website where the classes and functions were explained. I used https://www.w3schools.com/java and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org for learning some stuff. After that, I reviewed some of the old games that I made during Intro to CS on Processing and thought about which game to implement. At first, I was thinking about something not so complicated and famous, like the ping pong game, but then I have seen on Discord that someone has already done it. So I decided to make just a game, where the user can move the circle and eat 'fruits'. I think it was mostly motivated by the snake game, just without the lengthening of the tail. I thought that making the snake would take a lot more time and I had only one day, because of the other assignments and that's what I have made. Two kind of fruits: good ones, that increase the score if you take them, and the bad ones, which have a time of 4 seconds to dissapear and if you 'eat' them, the game ends. At the beginning I was thinking of implementing something like https://openprocessing.org/sketch/554613. However, even though the similarities between Java and C++ are enormous, I stuck with some data structures and the time, so I have left this idea. And only now, at 2 am 31.05.21 I found out that we have to make the whole game using only functions and not OOP. I hope it works too. 


The screenshot below shows the starting screen with the 'good fruit' that could be eaten and the score increments.

Next Screenshot shows the white 'bad fruit'. If you will eat it, the game ends and the third screenshot pops out.

This screenshot below shows how the end screen looks like. A rectangle with a number, which represesnts the score on it.
