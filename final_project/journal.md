# Piano Tiles

One of the first ideas I thought about was the recreaton of piano tiles. I have already worked on it for 28.06 assignment, where I made the touch detection from arduino. Now I am 
thinking of adding the tone to arduino to play some music and maybe adding the long tiles to the games that produce longer sounds
