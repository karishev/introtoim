# Making art using loadPixels


At first, I just wanted to take the colors of a pixel and then change them a little bit, so it looks like it gradually changes. However I didn't really get why that didn't work,
it just gradually changed to white, which wasn't what I wanted. After that, I decided to make something with the colors and change the row and col (p and i). It came out as in the 
videos below:

In the end of the program, it looks like the TV noise/buzzing effect.
