Right now I am thinking of implementing a copy of Doodle Jump game. 

<img src = "doodljumpscetch.jpg" width = 200px height = 300px style = "width = 50%; height = 50%;">

I haven't started anything, but I am thinking that it would be not as hard as it looks like. Surely, it will take some time, but I hope to implement it.
