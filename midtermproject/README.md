# Midterm Project

This folder shows the code and assets needed for the game made for the midterm project. I decided to recreate the popular mobile game called "Doodle Jump" in Processing. 
The game is about a character that jumps all the time and the user controls his X-trajectories and can shoot if needed. There are platforms that laet him go up and face challenges
as he goes through. I implemented two types of monsters and two types of platforms, one of which is moving in X-direction. I made 5 classes: Doodler, Platform, Monster, Bullet and Game class. I also made it possible to restart the game if needed after gameover screen.

Hope you will like the game and have fun playing it!
